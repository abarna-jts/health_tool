                                    <p>Technology has become a necessity in our daily life that cannot be completely dispensed with,
                                        and in order not to negatively affect public health, the concept of digital balance was 
                                        created. It does not represent a complete ban on the use of technology, but rather its 
                                        conscious and moderate use in accordance with our basic needs without affecting our 
                                        health and quality of life.â€‹</p>
                                    <p>And because the most used device is the mobile phone, this test assesses your relationship 
                                        therewith, and whether you have a fear of not being able to use the mobile phone or living without using it.</p>
                                    <p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> This test is not an accurate diagnostic tool, but an indicator of your dependency on mobile. Please indicate how much you agree or disagree with each statement in relation to your smartphone. </p>
